## Description:
This is a skeletal operating system from the bare bones tutorial at https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page.
Currently only contains a simple kernel for 32-bit x86 with very limited capabilities. 
> **_NOTE:_**  Run on Linux or WSL with GCC-11.4.0 and GNU Binutils 2.38 

## TBA: 
- Change to 64-bit kernel
- Terminal scrolling
- Try to reimplement in C++ (?)

### Target triplet
```
i686-elf-gcc
